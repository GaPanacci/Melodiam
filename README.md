   Melodiam is a song generator application that creates a melody based on a string of characters
inputted by the user. Letters, numbers, and special characters within the string are bound to a
unique sound, which the users can play at a fixed tempo. Accompanying visuals are generated in the
background based on the sound of the melody.
