**Melodiam**

**Overview**

Melodiam was created as a final cumulative project for my EECS 1022 class. The primary goal was to develop a Mobile Application through a software development life cycle combining some of the best features of Waterfall and Agile models.       


**Features**

Melodiam is a song generator application that creates a melody based on a string of characters
inputted by the user. Letters, numbers, and special characters within the string are bound to a
unique sound, which the users can play at a fixed tempo. Accompanying visuals are generated in the
background based on the sound of the melody. 


**Requirements**

- Android version 5.1 or higher
